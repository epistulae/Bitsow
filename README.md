Bitsow:
Brevity is the soul of wit.


Bitsow is an article summarizing app that makes it easy to quickly get the main points of news articles. 
Download the repositiory and run the xcode file to see it work in action. 


The application has a main table view that contains 3 preset filler "articles" that can be deleted.

Each cell in the table shows the article title, author, and publish date. 

There are two ways of summarizing an article. 
1) At the right top corner of Bitsow's main table, there is a + button. Upon clicking it, you are redirected to a page where you can paste a url. Once you click return on the keyboard, Bitsow will summarize the article and update the page with the extracted information. Click save in the top right corner to save the article to the main table.

2) Bitsow comes with an extension that will work for all web applications. Go to the page you wish to summarize in any browser application and share the page to Bitsow. The extension will automatically summarize the article and save it in the main application (see third picture below). You can then access the summary in the main table.

Note: All new articles are added to the bottom of the table.

Tapping a cell will show the details of the corresponding article. The two buttons on the top right in this detailed view will show either the summary (left image) or the full article (right image).

The articles will be saved in the application until you delete them using the edit button on the main table screen.
